## Project description

In this project, I have studied the principles of event analytics. I built a sales funnel, researched the users' path to purchase. Analyzed the results of the A/B test for the introduction of new fonts. I compared 2 control groups with each
other, made sure that the traffic was divided correctly, and then compared it with the test group. It was revealed that the new font will not significantly affect user behavior.

## Keywords
